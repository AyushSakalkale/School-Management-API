Project Title: School Management API


Description
This project is a School Management API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.
The API provides endpoints to manage schools, including adding new schools and listing them based on proximity.
It is designed to work with both local and remote MySQL databases and is deployed on Render.

Features
Add School: Add a new school to the database with name, address, latitude, and longitude.
List Schools: Retrieve a list of all schools, sorted by proximity to a given latitude and longitude.
Table Reset: Reset the schools table, useful for clearing the table during development or testing.

Prerequisites
Node.js
MySQL Server (Local or Remote)
Render (for deployment)
Git

Common Issues

MySQL Connection Errors:

Error: read ECONNRESET or Can't add new command when connection is in closed state.
Solution: This could be due to Renderâ€™s free tier limitations, such as the service spinning down due to inactivity. 
Use the keepAliveInitialDelay and enableKeepAlive options in the MySQL connection pool configuration to mitigate these issues.
Table Does Not Exist Error:

Error: Table 'sql12727430.schools' doesn't exist.
Solution: Use the API endpoint that resets and creates the schools table.
